Rather, it's more like its entry in the directory is deleted (unlinked). What can happen though is even if that entry is deleted the file could still be in use by a process or program and the space the file is using won't be freed for reuse until that program is done with it. While this is a legit technique for making sure temp files get deleted once a program ends, it is also used by malware and malicious hackers.\r\n\r\ncphf goes through and finds those unlinked but still in use files on a linux system and spills the deets on the files and the processes accessing them.  :D\r\n\r\n![sample cphf output](http://i.imgur.com/NPGZ3sG.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
