25 June 2015 	Welcome to the first alpha release of cphf! Right now output 
		options are limited to "report mode" however more digestible 
		output is on the docket.  Additionally right now cphf calls 
		out to lsof to find unlinked files. This will change in 
		future releases.  Up next is an overhaul of how attributes
		are being stored and handled. Also I want to go through all
		of the primitives and make sure no overflows are possible.
		If you find any bugs or have any suggestions please drop a line
		at github repository: https://github.com/x5Fhayling/cphf
