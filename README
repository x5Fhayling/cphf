Crouching Process Hidden File (cphf)
https://github.com/x5Fhayling/cphf
Spilling the details on unlinked files and the processes accessing them

When a file is deleted it usually isn't erased. Rather, it's more like its entry
in the directory is deleted (unlinked). What can happen though is even if that
entry is deleted the file could still be in use by a process or program and the
space the file is using won't be freed for reuse until that program is done with
it. While this is a legit technique for making sure temp files get deleted once a
program ends, it is also used by malware and malicious hackers.

cphf goes through and finds those unlinked but still in use files on a linux
system and spills the deets on the files and the processes accessing them. :D


Usage: cphf [--file no|acdgimMnpsu] [--proc no|cdDegGiMnPqrsSTuUv!]
NOTE: running cphf under different privileges will likely return different results
