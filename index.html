<p>When a file is deleted it usually isn't erased. Rather, it's more like its entry in the directory is deleted (unlinked). What can happen though is even if that entry is deleted the file could still be in use by a process or program and the space the file is using won't be freed for reuse until that program is done with it. While this is a legit technique for making sure temp files get deleted once a program ends, it is also used by malware and malicious hackers.</p>

<p>cphf goes through and finds those unlinked but still in use files on a linux system and spills the deets on the files and the processes accessing them.  :D</p>
